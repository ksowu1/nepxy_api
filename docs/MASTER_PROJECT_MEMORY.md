# Master Project Memory Update Instructions

Keep this file short, factual, and current.

## What to Add
- High-level system behavior changes (routing, auth, webhooks, payouts).
- New endpoints or critical flags/secrets.
- Non-obvious operational gotchas (staging gate, bootstrap flow).
- Data model changes that affect behavior.

## What to Avoid
- Long logs or verbose stack traces.
- Internal secrets or raw credentials.
- Temporary debugging steps that won’t persist.

## Format
- Bulleted lists only.
- Keep lines short.
- Prefer: “Behavior changed because…” or “Endpoint added: …”.
